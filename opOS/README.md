# OPOS \[opOS\]

## opOS - the 'operational Operating System'. (yeah, cool name.)



opOS uses the following principals:
1. Nothing works without the user. Set every module up **yourself**. If something doesn't work, you don't get to complain. You are the paranoid one here.
2. **Modularity** is the big word here. You can only use what you allow the operating system to use.
3. If you are *that* paranoid to use Linux or Windows, don't use any OS. opOS is meant for use if you're like *really*, ***really*** paranoid.
