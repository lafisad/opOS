# opOS vSex

1. What is opOS?
    opOS is a last resort. due to it being completely read-only, the user is the one who lets the system know when to write. kinda like when you suddenly boot into an initramfs and not into your os.
2. Is this just another Kali Linux?
    wtf no xD opOS is meant to like idk be used in high risk situations, when even a fucking linux from scratch is too risky for you. oh btw the code is like really stupid. oh and yeah! modularity! erm! there are like 3-4 vital components oh and we have opscript (wow!) which is a simple scripting language that can expand or completely multilate this fuckass system

    oh but this is written on a windows 11 machine so kys 

    i dont think opOS can even write to system, it can read and change when YOu tell it to but otherwise nah

3. why would anyone use this?
    honestly - idfk xD maybe ur scared of the nsa but if you have a post-2008 CPU you're fucked because of AMD PSP and Intel management bitch thingies. opOS is for when you want to control every single write, like forensics or some paranoid shit, or just when you wanna minimize risk as much as possible. if this is what you want, you probably should be locked up anyways lmao.

4. Current State:
    - Vital Modules (cuz this thing is useless without them):
        * security: paranoid read-only mode by default
        * hardware_scanner: tells u how fucked ur hardware is
        * shell: minimal af command line that judges your choices
    
    - Commands (type 'help' to see these):
        * help: shows this useless list
        * ro: ultra paranoid mode (default duh)
        * rw: actually lets you write (ur crazy)
        * ls: look around (trust no file)
        * cat: read stuff (could be trojans lol)
        * scan: check if ur still compromised
        * modules: see what vital shit is missing

    - Features:
        * Boots into paranoid mode
        * Scans and shames your hardware choices
        * Tells you how compromised you are
        * Judges your life decisions
        * Everything is read-only unless you're crazy enough to enable writes
